# TankGame_ASV
CSC413 Final Project 1 - Tank Game

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate competence in object-oriented programming by developing games in the Java programming language.
The task at hand was developing a simple game in which two players control a tank each, and attempt to destroy the other player in a classical
last-man-standing format, by either shooting them down with bullets, or by ramming into each other. Each player must do so in a finite arena, 
littered with obstacles that are to be avoided, as well as upgrades that can either rejuvenate the playersâ€™ tanks or increase the damage and 
speed of their bullets. Players can keep track of these objects, as well their own health and life counts in the center of the window; at the 
top is a shared minimap, and below that, a status screen showing the number of lives left per player, as well as a rough estimate of the health
left per life (shown as a healthbar, rather than showing the number of health points directly)


Import and Build instructions, as well as controls can be found in the Documentation.docx file.
